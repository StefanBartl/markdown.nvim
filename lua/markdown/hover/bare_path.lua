---@module 'markdown.hover.bare_path'
---@brief Find a filesystem path under the cursor that is not written as a link.
---@description
--- `markdown.hover` answers "what does the link under the cursor point at".
--- This module answers the same question for text that carries no link syntax
--- at all — a path sitting in prose, in a code comment, in a `:messages` dump:
---
---     ./assets/pdf_inline_hover.png
---     ../ROADMAP/ROADMAP.md
---     ...AppData/Local/nvim/init.lua:42
---
--- Everything downstream is unchanged: the raw string produced here goes into
--- `markdown.hover.classify` exactly like a link target would, so a bare path
--- gets the same image / PDF / markdown-section / file-head / directory
--- preview a linked one already gets. This module only widens *what counts as
--- a target*, never what a target can look like once found.
---
--- **Why gopath.nvim rather than `<cfile>` alone.** `<cfile>` reads a token
--- off the line under the cursor and stops there. gopath.nvim resolves the
--- awkward cases that a log or an error message actually produces: a
--- truncated path (`...nvim/init.lua`, `…/lua/config/init.lua`), a `:line:col`
--- suffix, a path only findable through `&path`/`rtp`/a tail search. That is
--- precisely the "a path in `:messages`, truncated or not, should hover too"
--- case, and it is gopath's whole subject matter — reimplementing any of it
--- here would be duplicating a sibling plugin for no gain. Soft dependency:
--- without gopath.nvim the `<cfile>` path below still covers ordinary
--- relative and absolute paths.
---
--- **Why existence is required.** A link is an explicit statement that
--- something is there, so `classify` reporting `missing` for a broken link is
--- useful. Bare text is not: every ordinary word under the cursor would
--- otherwise open a float saying "this target does not exist". So a bare path
--- must resolve to something real, or it is not a target at all.

--- Whether `str` is shaped like a path rather than an ordinary word.
---
--- Deliberately stricter than gopath's own heuristic: this runs on every
--- CursorHold in every buffer, so a plain word ("the", "config", "return")
--- must be rejected before any filesystem call. A separator or an extension
--- is the cheapest evidence that text was meant as a path.

---@internal
--- Whether `str` can *only* have been meant as a path.
---
--- The distinction that decides whether a **non-existent** target is worth
--- reporting. `looks_like_path` accepts a bare `name.ext` because `README.md`
--- in prose is a path — but so is `vim.api`, `string.format` or any Lua
--- module name, and those are the overwhelming majority of what a code buffer
--- puts under the cursor. Reporting those as broken paths would put a red ✗
--- on half the identifiers in every Lua file.
---
--- A separator or a `...` truncation is different: no identifier is spelled
--- `docs/setup.md` or `...nvim/init.lua`. Those were meant as paths, so if
--- they do not resolve, saying so is the useful answer rather than noise.
